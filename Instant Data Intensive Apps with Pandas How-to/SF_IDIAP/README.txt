Hi Reader,

First, thanks so much for purchasing this book.  I hope you really enjoy it and
learn alot.

This code is provided as a means to help you if necessary.  That said, it is
shouldn't (and isn't supposed to) replace following along in the book.  There
is some additional code in this code which isn't present in the book - most of
that though is to compensate for not being in a REPL.

Due to the file nature the following recipe are excluded:

    * Recipe 11 - Using Flask for the backend (Advanced)
    * Recipe 13 - Reporing with pandas objects (Medium)

Again, thanks so much.
